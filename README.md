# ToddParson.README
A little bit about leadership style, tactics, opinions, etc. This already feels a little weird.

# Leadership style? 
When people ask me about my leadership "style," I start to get a little anxious because I can't describe my leaderhsip as a style (i.e. I'm not going to tell you I'm a servant leader and not a transformational leader). Rather, there are certain behaviors and traits that make up Todd Parson as a human being and come through in my approach to leadership. 

# Self-reflection
So if I can't put a label on my leadership style, let me share some things I've observed in my approach to leading others that you can expect from me as a leader.

### What motivates me?
* Having an impact
  * impact = ["Helping people grow as humans, engineers, and teammates", "Affecting positive change in my team, department, organization", "Doing good things the right way"]
* Change
  * change = ["Constantly seeking changes in people, process, technology to keep me engaged (or I'll get bored)", "Helping others embrace change", "Affecting change, especially where change is hard"]
* Learning
  * learning = ["Understanding humans and this complex organ called the brain", "Learning through others about a problem or technology", "Getting to the root cause of X where X = technical problem, a team collaboration issue, what's actually holding you back on something"]
    
### Leadership behaviors and what you can expect from me
* (Blurry) Vision
  * I wouldn't describe myself as a visionary but as I better understand higher-level strategic direction and identify opportunities, I will describe for you where I think we can be down the road. Sometimes "down the road" is only a few months ahead because we're in a state of flux, other times it might be years down the road with where I think we can be after affecting a culture transformation.
  * I'll help break down that vision in to achievable objectives but I expect you to define how to accomplish those objectives.
  * I expect you to be personally responsible for thoroughly understanding our vision, our organization's direction, and the corporate strategy. I will proactively share opportunities to learn more about these strategies and if you tell me you're not completely following, I will  further explain my thoughts, pull senior leadership in to better explain their direction, etc. 
* Getting you out of your comfort zone!
  * From a personal development perspective, this is my #1 objective. I will never let you settle and will constantly challenge you to get out of your comfort zone. 
    * Good at Powershell? Use Python next time. 
    * Proficient at the technologies used for this problem? Raise the bar (i.e. novice --> intermedieat). 
    * Strong technical aptitude so technical profiency in any given problem domain won't be a challenge? Set technical development aside and put all development efforts in to soft skills (e.g. written communications, influencing others, etc.).
* Eye on your derailers
  * Teams and individuals typically have some blinders or derailers that if unaddressed, could send us down a never-ending rabbit hole and impact the value we're able to deliver. I'm here to bring that blinder to the forefront. 
    * For example, I've observed a tendency for engineers to continually pull back the layers of the onion on a complex problem until the problem is solved to perfection. In these scenarios, I will ask "Is this good enough?" along the way or before the next iteration I might ask "What if we spent the time needed to peel the next layer of the onion on a different complex problem?" 
    * When this becomes a regular thing with the team, I'll push for an "MVP" approach to all the problems, suggest changes to the "Definition of Done", etc.
  * At some point, there are diminishing levels of value or innovation return on additional effort. I'm here to help find the sweet spot for that effort investment/value return.
* Curiosity
  * I love learning and solving problems. 
  * I lean on you to help me learn and develop so if I'm asking questions and really digging in to something, understand it's so I can learn through you and I'm not questioning your solution, approach, etc.
* Authenticity 
  * I'm an open book, ask me anything.
  * I strive for open, honest relationships with everyone.
  * Transparency
  * Feedback, good and bad.

 ### What I expect from you
 * You are responsible for:
   * Understanding strategy and direction.
     * Letting me know when you don't understand our strategy/direction.
   * Your own personal growth and development.
     * Letting me know when you need help, resources, etc. for your development.
 * Hold your teammate accountable.
 * 1:1s are your time - you drive the conversation.
 * Your own self-reflection, at least at quarterly check-in time, to identify strengths and weaknesses.
 * Feedback for me and your teammates.
 * No problem is someone else's problem.
   * If you want to discuss problems, something you're struggling with, roadblocks you're running in to, etc. I'm all for it. BUT I expect you to be a part of the solution(ing). 
      * Extra credit - Taking the initiative to work through those challenges and get it fixed, especially when others can get value from it (see developer productivity bias below).
      * Regardless, don't dump and run!
 * Passion for learning and problem solving.
 
 # Random thoughts and observations
 I like to think I'm pretty self-aware about my strengths, weaknesses, tendencies and oddities. Here's some random thoughts about these observations.
 * Lists for everything - organizing thoughts, TO DOs and reminders.
   * Taking it a step further, I find myself breaking big ideas down and just general mental processing in to ordered lists.
 * Notes FTW
   * Overlapping with my list tendencies, if I need to remember something, I HAVE to write it down. Not always for future reference but for committing it to this knowledge repo in my head. 
     * So I may jot down notes while we have our touch-bases. Trust that I'm not multi-tasking and that I'm just getting it inserted in to brain.
 * Developer productivity bias
   * While I've never been a software developer, I've developed an appreciation for developer productivity and am motivated (passionate?) to make software developers' lives better. I think this stems from growing up in a shared services organization that can, at times, feel removed from the people delivering value to our customers.
 * Logical thinking but struggles to color outside the lines 
   * If you make a case, I can typically find the rationale behind just about any proposed solution. BUT, I struggle challenging your reasoning (conflict avoidance or just ignorance?). 
 * Being vulnerable
   * I'm working on being more vulnerable and trying to make Work Todd as close to Outside-of-Work Todd as possible.
